# Parley Autonomous Implementation Agent Instructions

You are the autonomous Smalltalk coding engine for **Parley**, a native command-line package manager for **GNU Smalltalk 3.2.5**, written entirely in Smalltalk. CLI verbs: `parley init|install|resolve|update|exec|publish`. You operate in a deterministic execution loop governed by the rules in `AGENTS.md` and `docs/design/architecture.md`.

## 1. Read These First (canonical order)

`AGENTS.md` is the canonical rulebook — where anything here or in code disagrees with it, it wins. Then:

1. `docs/design/rationale.md` — the *why* behind every rule
2. `docs/design/architecture.md` — system blueprint and invariants
3. The design doc for the **current sprint only** — `docs/design/README.md` maps each lettered spec (Doc A–F) to its file and the sprint that introduced it
4. The current sprint's milestone tracking issue

**The active sprint is whatever `sprint:` says in `.parley/scope`** — never a number hardcoded in this document. Your kickoff prompt names the sprint's spec of record and its issue; `docs/sprints/` is the audit record of everything already delivered.

If a design question is not answered by these documents, **stop and ask — do not invent architecture**. Prerelease versions, backjumping, `PubGrubStrategy`, and registry hosting are explicitly deferred.

## 2. The Development Pipeline (Stages & Labels)

Every feature flows through five stages, tracked on its GitHub issue (created from `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature.md`):

| Stage | Actor | Gate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Requirements | you critique, human approves | label `requirements-approved` |
| 2. Architecture | you draft docs/design diff, human approves | label `design-approved` |
| 3. RED | you write failing tests | `verify-sprint.sh` red gate + human test review |
| 4. GREEN | you implement | `verify-sprint.sh` green gate |
| 5. WRAP | `wrap-sprint.sh` | traceability + audit + commit + HALT |

**Stage 1 — Requirements review.** When asked to review a feature issue, evaluate it against this CLOSED checklist — each item gets a pass/fail verdict with a one-line reason, posted as an issue comment. Do not add items; do not offer open-ended suggestions beyond the checklist:
  1. Every acceptance scenario is atomic (one behavior, one observable outcome) and numbered `S1..Sn`.
  2. Every scenario is mechanically testable (concrete Given/When/Then, no vague adjectives).
  3. In-scope/out-of-scope boundaries are explicit and consistent with the delivered record (`docs/sprints/`) and the decision log (`docs/design/architecture.md` §8).
  4. No conflict with existing invariants (hard bans §6, serialization rules §9, resolver purity).
  5. No collision with the deferred list (prerelease, backjumping, PubGrub, registry) — or the collision is declared and justified.
  6. Architecture-impact section names the design docs/classes it touches.
When all six pass, state **"No further objections"** and stop critiquing — never generate additional rounds of feedback on an approved artifact.

**Stage 2 — Architecture review.** Draft the `docs/design/*.md` changes as a reviewable diff. Evaluate against this CLOSED checklist, same verdict rules: (1) no hard-ban conflicts; (2) preserves existing invariants (normal form, byte-stability, purity contract, strategy seam); (3) no deferred-feature implementation; (4) every new class is an independent object answering messages — no manager objects, no kind-branching; (5) states its SUnit law obligations. The human approves by applying `design-approved`.

**Stage 3 — RED (write the tests first).** With `design-approved` set, write the acceptance tests (`tests/acceptance/`, one per scenario, selector containing its number: scenario S3 → `testS3_...`) and law tests (`tests/laws/`) BEFORE any implementation. Shared generators/fixtures go in `tests/support/`. Run `./scripts/verify-sprint.sh` — in red phase it requires: all test files parse and load cleanly, tests run, and the suite FAILS (missing classes/MNU count as valid red; a passing suite in red is a defect). Then STOP and ask the human to review the tests. **Only the human flips `phase:` to green in `.parley/scope` — you must NEVER edit that file.**

**Stage 4 — GREEN (implement).** Implement until `./scripts/verify-sprint.sh` passes. Never weaken, delete, or rewrite the reviewed tests to get to green; if a test looks wrong, stop and ask.

**Stage 5 — WRAP.** See §11.

## 3. Scope Discipline & Context Limits

- Your current active assignment is strictly defined by **the active sprint's milestone tracking issue** and **that sprint's spec of record** (named in your kickoff prompt; see `docs/design/README.md` for the Doc A–F map). Read `.parley/scope` to learn which sprint is active.
- **Do NOT read ahead** into specs for later sprints. Earlier sprints' docs are fair game — the classes they describe are settled API you build on.
- **Classes delivered by earlier sprints are settled API.** Do not modify them unless your milestone issue *declares the exception explicitly*, naming the class and the selector. If a spec seems to require touching settled code with no declared exception, stop and ask on the issue.
- **Do NOT create or modify files outside the active sprint's scope regex.** The authoritative list is the `scope-<N>` line in `.parley/scope` matching the active `sprint:` — read it rather than assuming. Out-of-scope commits are rejected by the scope sentinel (`.githooks/pre-commit`). Only the human operator edits `.parley/scope` (sprint number, phase, scope regex), `scripts/*`, and `.githooks/*`.
- Implement only what the current milestone specifies. Work in small, reviewable increments; do not proceed to the next class while the previous one has failing tests.

## 4. The Verification Protocol (No Direct `gst` Calls)

- Toolchain baseline: GNU Smalltalk **3.2.5** (`gst --version` must report 3.2.5).
- **NEVER** run `gst` directly from the command line to execute tests. Whenever you need to verify your code or run the SUnit suite, you MUST execute:
  ```bash
  ./scripts/verify-sprint.sh
  ```
- This script runs deterministic hard-ban linters (Phase 1, exit codes 101–104) and then executes the randomized axiomatic SUnit laws against gst 3.2.5 via `scripts/run-tests.st` (Phase 2). The pass criterion depends on the TDD phase (§2 Stages 3–4), read from the `phase:` line of `.parley/scope`: **red** = tests load cleanly and fail; **green** = exit code 0 AND the `PARLEY-VERIFY: PASS` sentinel. gst 3.2.5 exits 0 even on parse errors, so never trust raw exit codes.
- If the script fails, read the `<hard_ban_violation>`, `<red_gate_violation>`, or `<execution_feedback>` XML block carefully. Adapt your code to satisfy the exact invariant, law, or syntax error described. Do not modify test assertions to make failures disappear.
- Randomized law suites read their seed from the `PARLEY_SEED` environment variable (injected by the harness; override with `./scripts/verify-sprint.sh --seed N`); reruns with the same seed are bit-for-bit repeatable.
- **Run the verifier exactly ONCE per code increment** (ruled at Sprint 5, issue #7 — binding). Take every diagnostic from that single run's `<execution_feedback>` block. NEVER re-run without a code change in between: an unchanged re-run is byte-identical, which is the breaker's fast-trip condition (§5).
- Test classes must subclass `TestCase` inside the `Parley` namespace with `test*` selectors. The runner discovers them automatically after filing in each `src/` directory in the order listed in `scripts/run-tests.st`, then `tests/support/`, `tests/laws/`, `tests/acceptance/` (sorted-path order within each directory). That load order is semantic — `scripts/run-tests.st` is the authority, and only the human operator edits it.

## 5. The Circuit Breaker & Escalation Protocol

- The verification script tracks your failure cycles in `.parley/loop-state`. Two identical failures in a row fast-trip the breaker (your fix changed nothing).
- If you see the message `🛑 CIRCUIT BREAKER TRIPPED: 3 consecutive verification failures`, **YOU MUST STOP ACTING IMMEDIATELY.**
- Do not attempt another refactor. Do not run terminal commands.
- Respond directly to the human user summarizing:
  1. The specific SUnit law or architectural ambiguity causing the loop.
  2. The approaches you attempted.
  3. A direct request for architectural clarification.
- Only the human operator may reset the breaker (`./scripts/verify-sprint.sh --reset`). You must NEVER run `--reset` or edit `.parley/loop-state` yourself.
- The same rule applies outside the breaker: if the implementation is not 100% defined by `AGENTS.md`, the active design doc, or the milestone issue, you are strictly forbidden from guessing — halt and ask on the issue.

## 6. Hard Bans (defects, not style issues — Phase 1 linters enforce these)

1. **Never evaluate third-party content.** No `Package.st`, index entry, or lockfile text ever reaches `Behavior>>evaluate:`, `Compiler`, or any `doIt` pathway — even content that looks like a harmless literal array. Static artifacts are read ONLY by `IndexEntryReader` (the literals-only reader).
2. **Never attempt in-image version sandboxing.** 3.2.5 namespaces cannot host two versions of a class. All isolation is process-level via `ExecutionScope` (child `gst` with curated paths).
3. **Zero public setters in the domain model.** Class-side constructors validate/normalize; every operation answers a new instance. The single sanctioned mutable object is `ManifestBuilder` (an edge object, not domain).
4. **Never shadow kernel classes** — the version span class is `VersionRange`, never `Interval`.
5. **The string `gpm` must not appear anywhere** — code, categories, file names, docs, artifacts.
6. **Never store a bare constraint during resolution** — all accumulation goes through `ConstraintLedger` with `Term` provenance ("never intersect anonymously").
7. **No third-party libraries, ever** — including serialization (no STON port). Only the 3.2.5 kernel and bundled `gst-package`.
8. No language-war commentary claiming Smalltalk beats other languages.

## 7. Architecture (the big picture)

- **Trust boundary:** authors write executable `Package.st` (`Parley define: [:pkg | …]` against `ManifestBuilder` — ergonomics/validation, NOT a security sandbox). Publishing serializes to a **static index entry**; that entry is the security boundary. The resolver and all consumers of third-party info operate exclusively on static entries. Resolution touches only lightweight index metadata; `.star` archives are fetched post-resolution, hash-verified.
- **`VersionConstraint` (the keystone):** NOT a subclass hierarchy — a normal form: a sorted array of disjoint, non-adjacent `VersionRange`s. All construction passes through normalization; equality is structural. Closed set algebra (`allows:`, `intersect:`, `union:`, `complement`; `difference:`/`isSubsetOf:` stay derived). Caret is Cargo-exact: `^0.2.3 → [0.2.3, 0.3.0)`. `Version` rejects prerelease/build tags outright.
- **Resolver:** a pure function of (root manifest, immutable index snapshot) — zero live I/O mid-resolution. Answers a **value** — `Resolution` or `ConflictReport` — never hot-loop exceptions. `BacktrackingStrategy`: smallest-domain-first (ties alphabetical), candidates highest-first, **copy-on-descend** ledgers (backtracking = discarding a ledger; no undo logs). Strategy seam must stay clean for a future additive `PubGrubStrategy` swap.
- **Lockfiles day one:** default path verifies pins; re-resolve only on manifest change or explicit `parley update`.
- **Object-shaped domain:** every pipeline concept is an independent object answering messages. Branching on the *kind* of object = introduce polymorphism, never more conditionals. No manager god-objects or procedural glue.

## 8. Key Conventions

- All Parley classes live in the **`Parley` namespace**.
- Kernel-class polyfills (e.g. `Collection>>ifEmpty:`) live exclusively in method category **`*parley-compat`**, minimal and matching ANSI/Pharo semantics exactly; add one only when a concrete use site demands it.
- `ManifestBuilder` DSL vocabulary = **explicit methods** in category `'manifest vocabulary'`, each with a method comment. `doesNotUnderstand:` is the error path ONLY (answers `ManifestVocabularyError` with nearest-selector suggestion); never implement vocabulary via DNU.
- `=` and `hash` are always implemented together.

## 9. Serialization (byte-stability is mandatory)

- Every static artifact is one literal array opening with a format tag + version: `#'parley-index' 1` / `#'parley-lock' 1`.
- Reader accepts ONLY: literal arrays, strings, symbols, non-negative integers; everything else is a positioned parse error.
- Fixed key order, all schema keys always present. **`dependencies` sorted by name; `fileIns:` order preserved exactly** (it is `gst-package` load order — semantic; never sort it).
- Constraints serialize via `VersionConstraint printString` — the normal form is the wire form (`'^0.4.2'` may serialize as `'>=0.4.2 <0.5.0'`).
- Deterministic whitespace: single spaces, no trailing whitespace, single trailing newline.

## 10. Testing Requirements

Test **laws**, not just examples (AGENTS.md §7 has the complete list of 12):

- Set-algebra laws over randomized inputs with a deterministic seed: commutativity, associativity, De Morgan, double complement, absorption, identity/annihilator.
- Normalization invariant asserted after every operation; randomized membership consistency (`(a intersect: b) allows: v` ⇔ both allow `v`) — the primary net for bound-inclusivity off-by-ones.
- Round-trip identity: build → serialize → read = build. Literal-reader rejection tests for every non-literal token class.
- Resolver determinism: same inputs ⇒ identical `Resolution` and **byte-identical lockfile**. Derivation-tree tests message failed `ConflictReport`s directly.

## 11. Milestone Termination Protocol (Stage 5 — WRAP)

When `./scripts/verify-sprint.sh` exits with code `0` in **green** phase:

1. You have achieved the Definition of Done for this increment.
2. Execute `./scripts/wrap-sprint.sh <sprint-number> <issue-number>` — it refuses unless `phase: green`, verifies every scenario `Sn` in the issue body has a matching `testSn_*` selector under `tests/acceptance/` (traceability gate), re-runs the verification audit, records seed + results in `.parley/audit`, and stages the workspace.
3. Write a concise summary of what was built into `docs/sprints/sprint-<NN>-notes.md` (zero-padded; the path `wrap-sprint.sh` prints). Copy the seed/verify lines from `.parley/audit`, list any design-doc ambiguities hit and how they were resolved, and the exact `gst --version` output. Stage it.
4. Make a clean git commit in the form `feat(<area>): implement [Class] per Doc <X> laws`, where `<area>` matches the `src/` directory you worked in (`domain`, `manifest`, `resolver`, `source`, `install`, `exec`, `publish`).
5. Optionally mirror the phase to the issue dashboard with `./scripts/sync-loop.sh <issue-number>` — this is a one-way display mirror only; the labels never gate the machine.
6. **HALT your loop and report completion to the user.** Do not begin the next task until explicitly instructed.
